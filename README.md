# Real-time recognition of human expression using CNN
The main objective of facial recognition is to identify the facial features. However,
the facial features are captured in real time and processed using haar cascade detection. The
sequential process of the work is defined in three different phases where in the first phase
human face is detected from the camera and in the second phase, the captured input is
analysed based on the features and database used with support of Keras Convolutional neural
network model. In the last phase human face is authenticated to classify the emotions of
human as happy, neutral, angry, sad, disgust and surprise. The proposed work presented is
simplified in three objectives as face detection, recognition and emotion classification. In
support of this work Open CV library, dataset and python programming is used for computer
vision techniques involved. In order to prove real time efficiency, an experiment was
conducted for multiple students to identify their inner emotions and find physiological
changes for each face. The results of the experiments demonstrate the perfections in face
analysis system. Finally, the performance of automatic face detection and recognition is
measured with Accuracy
